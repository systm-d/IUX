# Changelog

## 0.1.0-dev.3.1 — IUX-003.1

Remediation of the semantic layer. This release is **breaking** for the API
introduced by IUX-003. No published consumer exists (`publish_to: none`).

### Removed

Out-of-scope code that pre-empted later missions, along with its exports:

| Removed | Recreated by |
| --- | --- |
| `IuxButton` | IUX-008.4 |
| `IuxTextField`, `IuxCheckbox`, `IuxSwitch` | IUX-010, IUX-011 |
| overlay placeholders | IUX-016 to IUX-018 |
| `IuxLoadingState`, `IuxErrorState`, `IuxEmptyState` | IUX-028 to IUX-030 |
| `IuxSurface`, `IuxSection` | IUX-007 |
| `IuxActionDescriptor` and action enums | IUX-008.2 |
| `IuxAccessibility` | IUX-005 |
| `IuxFeedback`, `IuxMotionPolicy` | IUX-006 |
| `IuxTheme`, `IuxThemeProfile` | IUX-004 |

`IuxSemanticColors.fromColorScheme` is removed. It inverted the dependency by
placing the source of truth in Material, where IUX cannot verify contrast. See
ADR-0002.

### Changed

- `IuxSemanticColors` becomes a composition of six role groups — `content`,
  `surface`, `border`, `action`, `feedback`, `state` — instead of ten flat
  `Color` fields.
- `IuxSemanticColors.of` now throws a diagnosable `FlutterError` when no IUX
  theme is installed, instead of silently substituting colours derived from the
  ambient `ColorScheme`. `maybeOf` returns null for callers where absence is
  legitimate.

### Fixed

- `IuxSemanticColors.copyWith` accepted only `contentPrimary`, silently
  discarding every other role. It now covers the whole contract, and a
  regression test asserts it.

### Added

- Role groups: `IuxContentColors`, `IuxSurfaceColors`, `IuxBorderColors`,
  `IuxActionColors` / `IuxActionColorSet`, `IuxFeedbackRoleColors` /
  `IuxFeedbackColorSet`, `IuxStateColors` — each with `copyWith`, `lerp`,
  equality and hash code.
- An internal primitive palette, deliberately not exported.
- A contrast measurement helper, confined to `test/`.
- A contrast contract test matrix covering both demonstration mappings.
- A catalog that presents every role group, switches between light and dark
  mappings, and includes a single-hue check for colour-only signalling.
- Documentation: six role documents, contrast contracts, colour and non-colour
  signals, ADR-0002, and an evidence registry.

## 0.1.0-dev.1

- Initialized the IUX repository structure.
- Added the experimental `iux_flutter` package and local catalog integration
  surface.
